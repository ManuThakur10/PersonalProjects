Hello there! This is my movie recommender solo project. Steps to get this working:

1. Download the two csv files via the link in the dataset.txt file.
2. Download all imports necessary by opening the terminal in your IDE and using pip.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (handles data)
4. Run app.py (python file handling frontend/light backend)
